"# Vue-Basics" 
In this single page project I tried to use Vue.js with fake Api.
But only used with get request Because main reason to build this project was to understand how Vue dynamics work.

I also used bootstrap to visualise elements better.

For fake Api you need to run this command in terminal first
"npm install -g json-server"
and then this; 
"json-server --watch products.json"

But to understand how json-server works please check this link;

Now you can open the index.html file in browser.
